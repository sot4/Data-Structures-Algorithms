Good code can be described two things:
1-Readable
2-Scalable(BigO measure Scalable Code)

BigO notaion is the language we use talking about how long an algorithm takes to run

Time complexity(Speed) is how long it takes the algorithm to run 
and
Space complexity(Memory) is the Memory that is requierd by the algorithm.
